<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## First Day

This is the first day of our Apprenticeship. After settling the onboarding process, We were tasked with setting up our Mac system with the necessary software in preparation for the 40 days React Native Learning Course. We were issued a clear learning pathway by Anya and Russell and we will be learning from our colleagues as well as the Udemy platform. After today, I feel that there is plenty more to learn in my journey as a software developer.
