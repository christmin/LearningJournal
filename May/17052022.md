<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## React Native Training

Continuation of learning React Native on Udemy. Today's learning topic is React Native UseContext Hook.

## What is UseContext

- React Context is a method used to manage state globally.

- It can be used together with the useState Hook to share state between deeply nested components more easily than with useState alone.

- Context : Moves info from a parent to nested child component but more complicated to set up

- Need to import createContext from react

- Easier to communicate data from parent to a deeply nested child

- Wrap child components in the Context Provider and supply the state value.
