<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## Day Thirteen

It is day 13 of learning React Native on Udemy. Today's learning topic is RN state managment - how to manage state with reducer. As our 3 pieces of state done last Friday are closely related and have a precise set of well known method in which we update their values, this makes them an ideal candidate for being managed by a reducer. A reducer is a function that manages changes to an object.

## What is a Reducer

- Function that gets called with 2 objects
- Argument 1 - object that has all of our state in it
- Argument 2 - object that describe the updates we are going to make
- We use Argument 2 to decide how to chang Argument 1
- Dont change Argument 1 directly
- We must always return a value to be used a Argument 1
- Dispatch means run the reducer

## Action Items

[] Video # 57 - 59
Follow the steps to refactor the SquaresScreen with reducers.

[] Change to typescript + refactor as much as possible

## Learning Points

1. Type -> string that describes the exact change operation we are going to make

2. Payload -> some data that is critical to change operation
