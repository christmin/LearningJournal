<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## Day 2

Today is day 2 of my apprenticeship with Activate Interactive. It is the first day of working from home and we are to continue with our 40 days react native training. We had a meeting in the afternoon to discuss about any problems we faced.

Unfortunately, my react native starter project was not working and it took almost an entire day to resolve. Thankfully my mentors were really patient and helpful and we managed to resolve the issue by end of day.

I also read up on Typescript and practiced it a on Codecademy in between searching for solutions for my issue with the starter project.
